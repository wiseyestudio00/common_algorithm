create a possible order to loop through a graph with prerequisites for every node

def tolopogical_sort(graph):
	res = []
	set = set of all nodes with no incoming edge

	while s is not empty:
		remove a node n from set
		add n to res
		for each node m with an edge from n->m:
			remove the edge
			if m has no edge:
				add m to set
	
	if graph is empty:
		return res
	else:
		the graph doesn't have a tolopogical_sorting
